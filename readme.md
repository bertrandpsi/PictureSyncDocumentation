## Can I use a Microsoft account?
You should be able to use your Microsoft account via the following syntax as username:
```
MicrosoftAccount\me@domain.com
```
Make sure to keep the ```MicrosoftAccount``` part in your username. If it doesn't work, try to disable the "PIN" login (Settings > Accounts > Sign in options > PIN).

## How can I access my PC on my local LAN?
It usually works better if you provide the IP address of your PC. To know find your IP:

Your share will then look like something like: ```\\192.168.1.20\yourshare```

In the settings page, press the "Clear" button, and only pictures after that moment will be sync.

## What if I want to re-sync again all?
In the settings page, press the "Reset" button, and all the pictures are marked for sync.

## Does the sync work in background?
Yes the APP is able to sync in background automatically, however you may need to allow it to run in background:

- Allow the app to use data even if the data saving is enabled.

## Can I disable the automatic sync?
Yes! In the APP, go to the settings and disable the auto-sync.

## Can I choose which folder to sync?
Yes! In the APP, go to the settings and choose which folder to sync. The APP shows all the picture's folders found on your device. By having removing the checkbox on one entry you will disable that folder from the sync operation.
